    title:"In-vitro biomineralization study of eco-friendly synthesized borosilicate glass with strontium oxide as dopant",

    text: "We developed borosilicate glass using a sustainable melt-quench process, sourcing silica from rice husks and calcium oxide from eggshells. Strontium oxide (SrO) was added in varying amounts (0–5 mol%) to study its effect on structure and bioactivity. Characterization was performed using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, and EDS, while bioactivity was assessed in simulated body fluid (SBF) following ISO standards. Results showed that higher SrO content promoted hydroxyapatite layer formation and faster degradation, with the Sr-5 sample showing the highest weight loss (38%) after 21 days in SBF. Cytocompatibility tests with MG-63 bone cells confirmed non-toxicity and improved cell viability after SrO incorporation. These findings highlight the potential of SrO-doped borosilicate glass for orthopedic and dental applications.",

    title:"A novel approach to design chimeric multi epitope vaccine against Leishmania exploiting infected host cell proteome",
    img: "/images/carousel/Banesh-et.al-2024.jpg",
    text: "Leishmaniasis is a deadly infectious disease with no approved vaccine. We developed a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) by targeting unique membrane proteins from infected macrophages and Leishmania parasites. MHC-I, MHC-II, and B-cell epitopes were predicted and combined into different MEV constructs (1a–1m). Constructs 1a, 1k, 1l, and 1m demonstrated high antigenicity and strong simulated immune responses, with 1k emerging as the top candidate. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed strong binding of 1k to TLR-2, TLR-3, and TLR-4, and immune modeling showed close interactions with TLR-3, B-cell receptors, and MHC-II. Structural and immunogenicity analyses suggest that construct 1k has significant potential to trigger effective immune responses, warranting further experimental validation.",

    title:"Design and evaluation of a multiepitope vaccine for pancreatic cancer using immune-dominant epitopes derived from the signature proteome in expression datasets",

    text: "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest malignancies due to late diagnosis and therapy resistance. We integrated transcriptomic and protein expression databases to identify 143 differentially expressed proteins from an initial set of 21,054. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), helper T lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes were predicted for these targets, generating 51,840 multi-epitope vaccine constructs. After screening for antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and solubility, 86 top candidates were selected. Immune simulations revealed that constructs 41417, 37961, and 40841 could elicit strong immune responses, with construct 37961 showing the most stable interaction with TLR-9 in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. This construct also demonstrated 100% predicted solubility in E. coli. These results suggest that construct 37961 has strong potential as a pancreatic cancer vaccine candidate, warranting experimental validation.",
